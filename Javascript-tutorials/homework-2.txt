Question 1 (Continuing last week Q3)

There are two teams, team1 and team2. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

Example:
team1: 95, 120, 111,
team2: 89, 98, 100

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data above.
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print the winner to the console. The result of the match could also be a draw.
3. Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. A team could only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and score at least 100 points.
4. This requirement also applies to a draw. So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy.

Question 2

Use a switch statement to log the following string for the given 'day':
  monday: 'Not againnn :('
  tuesday or wednesday: 'Let's do this'
  thursday: 'Almost there'
  friday: 'Finallyyyy'
  saturday: 'Yayyy'
  sunday: 'It's Sunday already?'
  for all other day 'Invalid Input'

Question 3

Write a function called fooBar that takes a input integer n and print "foo" if n is divisible by 3,
print "bar" if n is divisible by 5 and print "fooBar" if n is divisible by 3 and 5. Otherwise just print the number.
