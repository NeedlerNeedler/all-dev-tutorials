Question 1
Write a function that takes an array as input and return an array with each item in
 the input array doubled.

For example, if the input is [1, 5, 9, 10] the function should return [2, 10, 18, 20].

Question 2
Write a function that takes an array as input and return the smallest number in the 
array.

For example, if the input is [10, 7, 2, 8], the function should 2.

Question 3
Given a number n, print n-th Fibonacci Number.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two
 preceding ones.
Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence begins
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....

For example, the 7th Fibonacci Number is 8 because 6th Fibonacci Number (5) plus 5th
 Fibonacci Number (3) = 8.
