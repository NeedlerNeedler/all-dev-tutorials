Question 1

Haley weights 65kg and is 1.66m tall. Alex weights 80kg and is 1.85m tall.

1. Calculate both of their BMI using the formula (BMI = mass / height ** 2)
2. Print a nice output to the console. The message is either "Haley's BMI (xx.x) 
is higher than Alex's (yy.y)" or "Alex's BMI (yy.y) is higher than Haley's (xx.x)"

Question 2

There are two teams, team1 and team2. They compete against each other 3 times. 
The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

Example:
team1: 95, 120, 111,
team2: 89, 98, 100

1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data above.
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
and print the winner to the console. The result of the match could also be a draw.

Question 3

Declare a variable 'booksReadPerYear' based on a prompt input like this: 
prompt('How many books do you read per year?');

Now, try to run this code:
if (booksReadPerYear == 1) {
  console.log("I read one book per year.")
} else if (booksReadPerYear > 1) {
  console.log("I read a lot.")
} else {
  console.log("I don't read.")
}

Now, try to change the previous code to this:
if (booksReadPerYear === 1) {
  console.log("I read one book per year.")
} else if (booksReadPerYear > 1) {
  console.log("I read a lot.")
} else {
  console.log("I don't read.")
}

What do you notice when the book you read is exactly one per year?
